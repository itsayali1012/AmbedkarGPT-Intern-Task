The real remedy lies in removing the belief that the shastras are sacred and unquestionable. Progress is not possible if people continue to hold these texts as infallible. One must take a clear stand. Either the practice of caste must end, or the blind belief in the shastras must end. Both cannot exist together. 
The caste problem is not a simple matter of social reform. It is a deeper struggle against the authority that the shastras hold over society. As long as people continue to treat these scriptures as sacred, they will never break free from the caste system. 
Social reform, when done without addressing the root cause, is like a gardener who keeps trimming the leaves and branches of a tree but never touches the roots. The real issue is the belief in the sanctity of the shastras. Until this belief is challenged and rejected, the foundation of caste will remain untouched.
